# myFlix App - Frontend
## Project Description
This is the client side component of a "movies" web application based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database). The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, genres, and directors. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
## User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about movies I've watched or am interested in.
* As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.
## Project Features
* Return a list of ALL movies to the user
* Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it's featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user
* Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., "Musical")
* Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name
* Allow new users to register
* Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)

* Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites
* Allow existing users to deregister
